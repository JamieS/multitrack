= What is this?

MultiTrack helps with an issue that will come up sooner or later in any commercial 
web application business: Tracking marketing spend. 

Most businesses use Google Analytics for this purpose. For example, you can store the _umtz 
cookie from the Google Analytics with each signup for later analysis. 

However, the problem is that you will only track the last click before the signup. This leads
to very inaccurate results. Often customers come to a website many times through different 
channels before they decide to pull the trigger. For example, if a fresh customer came to you by 
entering your brand name in Google does she really come from an organic search? 
How did she find out about your brand? Maybe she has been to your website a month 
ago after she clicked on a banner, and maybe a week ago after seeing a article on a blog!

To get a good handle on the effectiveness of your marketing spend you have to attribute the signup 
to all these sources equally (or better, develop a weighted algorithm). 

This project aims to keep a full log of visits in a DB table and provide a convenient unique_id cookie 
for storing with the signup. Just set up your own copy on your servers, add /track.js to your product 
homepage and everything else is taken care of.

= Todo

* Allow export API (csv, json)
* Add realtime(?) dashboard
* Add classification of referrers into categories such as Search engines, social media, paid
  sources like Google CPC, Retargeting and so on. 
* perhaps make tracking cookies more sticky, taking lessons from http://samy.pl/evercookie/
